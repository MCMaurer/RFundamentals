# REPL - 

A REPL is a Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.

We start an interpreter (R, python, MATLAB, etc.)
and it gives us a prompt, waiting for our command.
It is awaiting and reading our input.
Each character or line we write, it processes.

When we write a line, the interpreter **parses* the text and 
1) makes complete sense as a command, 2) indicates a syntax error, or 3) an incomplete command that makes partial sense
and that needs to be completed.

There are two steps in an R command - checking it is syntactically correct,
and then if it makes sense - semantically correct.

If the command is complete and legitimate, i.e. makes sense syntactically, R tries to evaluate the
**expression**.  R **parses** the text of the command to see if it is syntactically correct.
If it is not, we get a syntax error.
There are so many ways to write a command that is not syntactically correct.
For example,
```r

```
