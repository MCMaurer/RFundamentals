+ What happens in the following call:
```r
scatter.smooth(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt, family = "gaussian", x = "Weight of car", y = "Miles per Gallon")
```


+ I was looking for a function in one of the packages that come with R
that had a ... parameter and that also had a parameter that came after the ...
How did I find scatter.smooth() programmatically?
