# Writing Functions

More than the syntax, one wants to understand the ideas, *concepts* and **process** of writing functions.

We can create an R function very easily with
```
function()
  4
```
We have not assigned the function to a name - a variable.
So when we define it, it disappears.
But
```
f = function()
          4
```
does assign the function to a variable.
Like we defined variables [before](Variables.md)
