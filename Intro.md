This brief mini-course focuses on explaining the computational model that underlies R.  I believe
that if you understand this, you can **reason** about the R code and the language and can more
rapidly solve (and avoid) problems with your code.  This approach is different from learning by
examples close to your needs and adapting existing code.  Both approaches are valuable, but the
fundamentals provide the foundation to grow.

This mini-course does not attempt to teach you lots of functions and packages that you
use on a daily basis. Instead, it is focused on R's language and computational model.



I expect lots of questions.
So speak up if anything is not clear.

What topics do you want to cover in the remaining sessions?
 What do you find the hardest thing to understand about R?
 Try to keep it about the language and how it works than a function in a particular package.
